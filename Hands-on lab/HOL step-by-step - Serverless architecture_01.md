## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hand-on lab, you will be challenged to implement an end-to-end scenario using a supplied sample that is based on Microsoft Azure Functions, Azure Cosmos DB, Event Grid, and related services. The scenario will include implementing compute, storage, workflows, and monitoring, using various components of Microsoft Azure. The hands-on lab can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with other members at the lab to model a real-world experience and to allow each member to share their expertise for the overall solution.

At the end of the hands-on-lab, you will have confidence in designing, developing, and monitoring a serverless solution that is resilient, scalable, and cost-effective.
