### Task 1: Delete the resource group in which you placed your Azure resources

1. From the Portal, navigate to the blade of your **Resource Group** and select **Delete** in the command bar at the top.

2. Confirm the deletion by re-typing the **resource group name** and selecting **Delete**.

3. If you created a different resource group for your virtual machined, be sure to delete that as well.

4. Optionally, delete the GitHub repository you created for this lab by selecting **settings** and then **Delete this repository** from the GitHub website.
